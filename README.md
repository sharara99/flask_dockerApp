# Flask Docker App

This project is a basic Flask web application that demonstrates how to serve dynamic content using Flask. The application runs inside a Docker container and includes a simple HTML template that displays a colored background.

## Features

- **Flask Web Framework:** The application uses Flask to serve a webpage.
- **Dynamic Content:** The background color of the page can be set dynamically through the Python code.
- **Dockerized:** The app is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run on any system with Docker installed.
- **Jenkins Integration:** A Jenkinsfile is included for CI/CD pipeline integration.
